"Before flexbox and grid, we had to use the CSS float property to make grids and layouts. [...] But using float to build complex layouts was always a hack: it was only really designed to let text wrap around an image."

-"The clearfix, for those unaware, is a CSS hack that solves a persistent bug that occurs when two floated elements are stacked next to each other. When elements are aligned this way, the parent container ends up with a height of 0, and it can easily wreak havoc on a layout.
